# hello-world
This is my first time creating my own repository on GitHub, as part of my learning process.
This is a Markdown page I'm writing to test out the "branch" I created on github. Today is week2's Monday of the fall quarter, 2022. I am currently taking cogs108 as one of my essential GE course.
